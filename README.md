# Visuals, Styling, and Responsive Design # 

Date: September 25, 2025 

Description of Changes: 

External Stylesheet Creation: Created a new, central stylesheet named style.css. 
HTML Refactoring: Removed all inline <style> blocks from all existing HTML files. 

Stylesheet Linking: Linked every HTML page to the new style.css file using the <link> tag in the <head> section. 

Base Styling: Added a CSS reset and established base styles for the entire website, including a consistent font family (Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif 

), font sizes (rem units), and a color palette using CSS variables (--primary-color, etc.). 

Typography: Applied typography styles with font-family, font-size, font-weight, and line-height for h1 through h6 and p tags. 

Layout Structure: Implemented Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout on key pages, such as the navigation bar and program grid, to ensure a robust and flexible design. 

Visual Styling: Applied decorative styles using background-color, box-shadow, and border-radius. Added pseudo-classes like :hover to interactive elements to improve user experience. 

Responsive Design Implementation: Built a fully responsive interface using @media queries (tablet and mobile breakpoints) and relative units (em, rem, vw) to ensure font sizes and layouts scale correctly, successfully switching complex views to a single-column display on smaller screens.

Base Body: The main content area uses a dark grey background with white text to ensure readability and a sleek, premium look. 

Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons: Primary buttons are styled with a Neon Pink background and white text to maximize visibility and drive conversions. 

CSS Variables: (Implied improvement) Color values are stored as CSS variables (e.g., --primary-black, --accent-pink) for easy maintenance and global consistency.
