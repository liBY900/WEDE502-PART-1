Base Styling: Added a CSS reset and established base styles for the entire website, including a consistent font family (Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif 

), font sizes (rem units), and a color palette using CSS variables (--primary-color, etc.). 

For the whole website we styled it using external styling and for different page styling we used internal .

Typography: Applied typography styles with font-family, font-size, font-weight, and line-height for h1 through h6 and p tags. 

Layout Structure: Implemented Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout on key pages, such as the navigation bar and program grid, to ensure a robust and flexible design. 

Visual Styling: Applied decorative styles using background-color, box-shadow, and border-radius. Added pseudo-classes like :hover to interactive elements to improve user experience. 

Responsive Design Implementation: Built a fully responsive interface using @media queries (tablet and mobile breakpoints) and relative units (em, rem, vw) to ensure font sizes and layouts scale correctly, successfully switching complex views to a single-column display on smaller screens.
